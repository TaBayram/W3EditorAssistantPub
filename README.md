# W3EditorAssistant
 
## Description:
A junior assistant to help you with the modding.
Yes, another colorizer. But wait there is more! This one is cool I swear.

## Features:


1. Tooltip:

* Learn: Generate the ability's learn tooltip with the given level count.
*  Unit: Load the wc3 map folder, choose a unit, and start the magic. Type any unit field in curly brackets and watch it generate the value! Example: {ua1c} -> 1.35 (its unit's first attack cooldown field).
* Other: for the other stuff I guess. You can color.
* Save & Load feature for tooltips. Make an epic tower description and save it to use later for the new races!

2. Unit:

* Basic DPS & eHP calculation.
* Like the unit tooltip, you can load the map folder and select a unit to automatically fill the values.

3. Calculators:

* Cone area calculator: For spells that have line AOE.
* Circle area calculator: For spells that have circle AOE.
* Percentage calculator: Ever wondered what is the 20% of 100? I did too.
* Damage calculator: Simple damage over time calculation.
* Autofill Reverser: When you forget what you had generated the values with on the ability field, use this.

## Requirements:
-Windows 10/11

## Future:
-More custom fields and modifiers for unit tooltip.
-Better user experience. ( I need feedback for this :)
-Suggesting the dps/ehp of the unit given the cost of it. (Useful for td maps)
-Suggesting the ability's value based on damage, slow, stun, heal, cooldown, mana cost, area. (oof this one is hard)
